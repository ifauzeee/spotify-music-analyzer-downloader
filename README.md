## üìñ About The Project

This project transforms the original command-line tool into a full-featured, modern web application using Flask. It provides a seamless user experience for securely authenticating with Spotify, running complex music analysis in the background, and downloading tracks directly from your browser. The entire interface is designed to be clean, intuitive, and responsive, with a focus on providing powerful features in a simple package.

The application leverages background threading to handle long-running processes like fetching thousands of songs or downloading large files, ensuring the user interface remains responsive. A live progress bar keeps the user informed, creating a smooth and interactive experience from start to finish.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.8+**
-   **A Spotify Account** (Free or Premium)
-   **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    https://github.com/ifauzeee/spotify-music-analyzer-downloader.git
    cd spotify-music-analyzer-downloader
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    This isolates the project's dependencies from your system.
    ```sh
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows (PowerShell)
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Spotify API Credentials**
    You need to register an application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard to get API keys.
    
    a. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in.
    
    b. Click **"Create App"**. Give it a name and description.
    
    c. Once created, you will see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy these.
    
    d. Click **"Edit Settings"**. In the **Redirect URIs** field, add the following URL exactly:
       ```
       [http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback](http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback)
       ```
    e. Click **"Save"**.

5.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file will securely store your API keys.
    
    Copy the following content into your `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.
    ```env
    # .env
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
    SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI="[http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback](http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback)"
    ```
    > **Note:** The `.gitignore` file is already configured to prevent this file from being uploaded to GitHub.

## üéÆ Usage

1.  **Activate Your Virtual Environment**
    ```sh
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

2.  **Run the Flask Application**
    ```sh
    flask run --port=8888
    ```

3.  **Open Your Browser**
    -   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/`.
    -   The application will automatically redirect you to the Spotify login page for authentication.
    -   After you grant permission, you will be redirected back to the application's home page, fully logged in.
    -   From there, you can choose to analyze your liked songs, a playlist, or go to the downloader page.
