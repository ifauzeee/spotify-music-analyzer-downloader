## üìñ About the project

This project transforms the original command-line tool into a full-featured, modern web application using Flask. It provides a seamless user experience for securely authenticating with Spotify, running complex music analysis in the background, and downloading tracks directly from your browser. The entire interface is designed to be clean, intuitive, and responsive, with a focus on providing powerful features in a simple package.

The application leverages background threading to handle long-running processes like fetching thousands of songs or downloading large files, ensuring the user interface remains responsive. A live progress bar keeps the user informed, creating a smooth and interactive experience from start to finish.

## üöÄ Getting started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.8+
- **Spotify account:** Free or Premium
- **Git:** For cloning the repository

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ifauzeee/spotify-music-analyzer-downloader.git
   cd spotify-music-analyzer-downloader
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**  
   This isolates the project's dependencies from your system.
   ```sh
   # Create the environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate on Windows (PowerShell)
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

   # Activate on macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   Install all required Python packages from the requirements file.
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Spotify API credentials**  
   Register an application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard to get API keys.

   - **Open dashboard:** https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   - **Create app:** Provide a name and description.
   - **Copy credentials:** Note your Client ID and Client Secret.
   - **Edit settings:** Add this Redirect URI exactly:
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
     ```
   - **Save changes** on the dashboard.

5. **Configure environment variables**  
   Create a file named `.env` in the project root to store your API keys.

   ```env
   # .env
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
   SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback"
   ```

   > Note: The `.gitignore` is configured to prevent this file from being committed.
